Major things
============
    * allow input from files not just STDIN
      * Let grep take only one pattern
      * Add filename handling to grep (-l, -L, -h (as -s) options).
    * reimplement in C or Haskell
    * make a comp function that compares two or more fasta files
    * handle fasta indexing (this requires intput from named files, not STDIN)

Minor things

    * add color subcommand (color sequence by letter, optionally amino acid class)
